Purpose of the App
The Flashcard Quiz App is a fun and educational app that helps users test their history knowledge using a series of true/false questions. The app gives instant feedback on each answer and shows the final score and a review of all questions at the end.
This app was created as part of the IMAD5112 module to practice using Kotlin, Intents, multiple Activities, and user interaction in Android development.

Design Choices
The app was built with simplicity and clarity in mind. Below are the key design choices:
* Layout: LinearLayout was used for a vertical flow of content, making it easy to read on all screen sizes.
* Start Screen: Includes a bold app title, a description, and a “Start Quiz” button to begin.
* Quiz Screen: Each flashcard question appears with two buttons (True and False), instant feedback text, and a “Next” button.
* Score Screen: Displays total score, motivational feedback, and a review option to see all answers.
* Feedback: After each answer, the app shows “Correct!” or “Incorrect!” in red for quick learning.
* Color Theme: A clean black-and-white theme was used for clarity and accessibility.

Using GitHub
GitHub was used to manage and save the project code. It helped in:
* Tracking progress through regular commits.
* Version control to go back to previous stages of the app.
* Making it easy for lecturers to view and assess the code online.

Using GitHub Actions
In this project, GitHub Actions was not fully used, but the plan is to include it in future projects to:
* Automatically check for code errors.
* Ensure the app builds correctly before submission.
* Help automate testing and save time during development.
